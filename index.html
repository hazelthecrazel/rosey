Detailed Info
</div>
</div>
<div id="content2">
  <b>Appearance</b><br>
  Rose is about the average height of a human female and her skin is tinted a salmon pink shade which is the only thing that could separate her from a normal human's appearance physically. She has a distinct hourglass shape, making her appear very feminine and dainty while masking the thick layer of muscles underneath. Rose's facial structure is unique to her own self rather than her body being much like the desired womanly shape. Her head is the perfect mix of being both circular and oval shaped but with a slightly rounded chin that blends seamlessly back into her jawline rather than making a sharp point. Her cheekbones are prominent and the perfect distance between her eyes and jawline that gives her a slight dip between her cheekbones and forehead. Her nose is average shaped and of average length and her lips are plush and naturally red to make a distinction between skin and lips.<br>
  Her eyes are almond shaped and a bright shade of baby blue, her black lashes thick and long. Rose's eyebrows start into a quick fade to the actual brow hairs before becoming thick and dark. They arch towards the brow bone and make a nice point. There is a small circle in the middle of her forehead that is tinted a light shade of pink, most likely an odd tattoo choice but is in fact a simple birthmark. Hair, along with her skin, is another aspect that is attention grabbing and non-human in appearance. It is white with silver-blue highlights that make for a very interesting and unique color when hit by light. This is completely naturally grown. It is long and reaches down to the small of her back in slight waves. When styled up, streaks of a light blue can be seen among the white hairs.<br><br>
  <b>Personality</b><br>
  Rose is a reckless and impulsive person, enjoying partying, drinking, boys, and often getting herself into trouble just for fun. Considered somewhat flirty towards males, she is not necessarily a promiscuous person. She holds little respect for authority figures but is quick to feign some in certain situations to keep herself from getting her ass beat. She can also be somewhat violent towards those who antognize her, not really caring for people who keep her name in their mouth. She normally has the reputation of someone who you don't want to pick a fight with. Basically, she isn't all talk: not only can she shoot out hilarious and seething comebacks, but she packs a mean punch.<br>
  Rose uses what others have grown to call "Rose-logic." Rose-logic mostly just entails trying to find loopholes in everything in order to rationalize doing something unreasonable, or when she tries to justify something that makes little sense. She can be extremely stubborn in her opinions and won't hesitate to speak her mind. Despite all of this, Rose feels a strong sense of loyalty and protectiveness to others. She cannot stand to sit back and see people get hurt, always trying to do something to help wherever possible even if for a complete and total stranger.

  <b>Reduced Aging</b><br>
  Alturen do not follow the typical biological clock of the average human being even if they appear physically similar. Instead, their bodies are full of cells with immensely powerful vitamins and chemicals which inhibits the damaging of cells which in turn heavily reduces the rate at which cells die. Instead of dying at the age of 80 like a normal person, Alturen can live for hundreds of years and only show minimal signs of aging. They do have the ability to reproduce normally, but a newborn Alturen has not been recorded for upwards of two thousand years.
  <br><b>Enhanced Senses</b><br>
  The Alturen are capable of detecting noises and perceiving sound twice as effectively as a human being, but this makes them twice as vulnerable to sound based attacks. Pairing with their sensitive hearing, Alturen also have sensitive noses that are capable of detecting smells twice as effectively as a human being, but this makes them twice as vulnerable to scent based attacks
  <br><b>Heightened Reflexes</b><br>
  In comparison to the average human being's, Alturen have reflexes equal to double that standard which allows them to notice things and react to things twice as fast.
  <br><b>Athletic Body</b><br>
  The Alturen have naturally higher physical capabilities due to their muscles which are twice as strong and durable than the average human's. However this does make them take twice as long to heal when injured. This makes them twice as strong and as fast as a human with ease. With their metabolism ridiculously high, they can eat as much as they can and still retain their rather fit and athletic builds
  <br><b>No Food</b><br>
  Unlike most other creatures, the Alturen have no need for actual food (but they may still eat and digest food properly, it just does not yield any nutritional value), and instead regenerate their energy through extensive periods of sleep that can last for up to twenty four hours if exhausted, but a quick nap is more than enough to restore the amount of energy needed to do a decent run.
  <br><b>Endorphin Bite</b><br>
  On any normal occasion, Alturen appear to have teeth identical to a human's, at least until something sets them off. When feeling an intense amount of rage, or even at their own will, their Canine teeth elongate and sharpen into three inch long fangs capable of shredding through iron defenses. These fangs secrete a liquid packed full of endorphins that numb pain when released into the bloodstream, but also thins out blood akin to a Komodo Dragon's venom. This causes the bite wound and any other bleeding injury to continuously bleed until the body has either fought off the toxin (which can take up to two posts) or a Faith mage of at least mage rank cleanses the victim's blood. Large bite wounds can cause the affected to succumb to anemia in two posts if not healed.
  <br><b>Arcane Weakness</b><br>
  Although Alturen are naturally attuned to the magic arts, they suffer from the inability to counter raw Arcane Energy. This makes them take twice as much damage from Arcane Energy-based attacks.

  <b>Opal Necklace</b><br>
  One of the few personal belongings that Rosaline brought with her from her home. It is a simple chain necklace with a durability of tin and can be broken very easily. A small beautiful opal sits in the cradle of a series of metal loops that sit upon her breast bone at all times. This necklace was inherited from Rosaline's mother after her death and she has not taken it off since.

<div id="tab3">
"<i>The most basic class of magic, involving the direct manipulation of Mana, and is available to all mages. Raw Mana is a mundane source of magic with no special qualities, but offers some level of versatility. The amount of Mana a mage is capable of replenishing or expelling is dependent on their overall level.</i>"
  <br><br><b>Mana Weave</b><br>
  The simple act of moving one's mana pool through their own body. Channeling one's mana. <br>
  <b>Mana Spark</b><br>
  A basic mana projectile that can be used offensively or defensively. It causes no real damage other than a small sting when hit directly in the flesh

"<i>Easily the most cumbersome of all the Relic Weapons, Ragnarok resembles a scythe used to harvest crops. With a blade of around six feet in length, it would require a truly odd specimen to wield such a thing. When swung, Ragnarok projects a large slash of energy forward, rending physical objects it touches. (This projectile may only destroy objects of tin hardness or less at Paige. This will scale as rank increases.) Found within the Free Lands, sticking out of the ground like a metal scarecrow. The Alumni who chooses this weapon will find that the blade will unearth itself for them.<br>
Tier 2 Ability: After reaching Grand Alumnus, the wielder of Ragnarok will find they are able to focus the same energy that creates the slash projections into the scythe blade. When swung in this state, the blade will tear through all realities and dimensions at once. Mana pool, soul, and any other energies or substances in the way of this slash (that the blade can cut, of course) will be damaged, even if they currently exist in another plane of reality. (I.E.: Stepping into another dimension will not stop being injured by this attack. Anything that occupies the same location, even if on another plane, will be damaged.)</i>"
  <br><br><b><p align="center">Mana Cancellation</b><br><p align="left">
  Unlocked at Paige. Alumni may only cancel spells that are equal to or lower than their rank. In order to negate a spell, they must expend the same amount of mana used to create it. An Alumni also has to be aware of the spell and have the intention to cancel it in order for negation to be activated. Antimagic must have purpose when used.
